A Top Down driving game where player has to avoid turrets and shoot them down

# Unity Version : 2021.1.22f1

# Game Flow
* Game starts with the Car selection screen. User can select any of the 3 available cars
* After the selection of the car, the user is shown the weapon selection screen where a weapon type is selected and the game time limit is also choosen from the dropdown menu.
* Once the game starts the objective is to get the most number of turrets kill in the given time or kill all the turrets if the no time limit option is selected.
* The game is over when the player's health is depleted.
* Everytime a turret bullet hits the player, the car loses part of its health.
* Health can be recovered by picking health pickup that are dropped when creates are destroyed
* There are two power ups as of now:
  * Health pickups
  * Ammo pickups
      
# Known Issues:
 ## The player controls can be improved upon.
 ## The camera follow can be improved upon. Rather than the camera just following the okayer, it can be made to increase in height with respect to the speed of the car
 
# To be added:
 ## AI Cars that roam around and follow and shoot the player when the player gets into range.
 ## Missle system for the player.
